# Organizing Rust Projects and Managing Keys

This guide provides best practices for organizing Rust projects and handling sensitive keys. By following these guidelines, you can maintain a clean project structure and ensure the security of sensitive information.

## Project Structure

A well-organized Rust project typically follows a structure that separates source code, configuration files, and other resources. Here's a basic outline:

```
my_project/
│
├── src/                   # Source code directory
│   ├── main.rs            # Main entry point
│   └── lib.rs             # Library code
│
├── key/                   # Directory for sensitive keys
│   ├── -env.sh            # Script for setting environment variables
│   └── README.md          # Description of key files
│
├── Cargo.toml             # Project metadata and dependencies
└── .gitignore             # Files and directories to ignore in version control
```

## Handling Keys

Sensitive keys, such as API keys, database credentials, and environment variables, should be managed carefully to prevent unauthorized access. Here's how to handle them effectively:

### 1. Collect Keys in a Dedicated Folder

- Create a directory named `key` to store all sensitive key files.
- Prefix each key file with a hyphen (`-`) to easily identify and manage them.

### 2. Minimize the Number of Key Files

- Use as few key files as possible to simplify management and reduce the risk of exposure.
- Consider consolidating all key-related information into a single file where feasible.

### 3. Provide a Single Script for Environment Variables

- Create a single `.sh` script (e.g., `-env.sh`) to set all necessary keys as environment variables.
- This script can be sourced to apply the environment variables to your current shell session.

### 4. Add a README in the Key Folder

- Include a `README.md` file in the `key` directory.
- Provide a description of each key file, explaining its purpose and usage.

Example `README.md`:

```markdown
# Key Directory

This directory contains sensitive keys and configuration files. Below is a description of each file:

- `-env.sh`: Script for setting environment variables.
```

### 5. Use .gitignore to Exclude Key Files

- Add an entry in your `.gitignore` file to exclude all files starting with a hyphen (`-`) from version control. This prevents sensitive information from being accidentally committed to your repository.

Example `.gitignore` entry:

```
/key/-*
```
